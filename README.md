# Lexical Analyzer
- Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler.
- It converts the High level input program into a sequence of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.
- In programming language, keywords, constants, identifiers, strings, numbers, operators and punctuations symbols can be considered as tokens.
